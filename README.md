### For Cartography Professionals and Amateur Map Makers Alike

Fresco is an open source [Mapbox Vector Tile Style](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec) editor that allows cartographers to craft stylesheets for use with [Mapbox GL](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) maps. Unlike other style editors, Fresco does not attempt to hide the complexity of Mapbox GL Styles - but rather exposes and surfaces it for maximum control and flexibility. This allows the user to implement rich, interactive styles utilizing data driven properties with [expressions](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/mapbox-gl-js-expressions/).

When using Fresco, it may be helpful to have the [Mapbox Style Spec](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/) available as a reference.

Fresco runs in the browser and styles created and modified with Fresco are saved to the browser's local storage and are synced on changes. Be sure to download styles to your computer as a backup. Remote style storage and collaboration tools are coming soon.

## Usage

Fresco may be used in the browser by visiting [https://fresco.gospatial.org/](https://fresco.gospatial.org/) or by downloading a pre compiled binary from the [releases](https://github.com/go-spatial/fresco/releases) page.

## Running from source

Fresco is built on top of React. To run Fresco from source use the following steps:

1. Download the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), or (as of 11.3.2020) just use node v12.19.0 ('nvm use 12').
2. Clone this repository to your computer
3. Navigate to this repo on your computer
4. Run `npm install`
5. To startup, run `npm start` - Fresco should open in a browser window
6. To build Fresco for deployment run `npm run build` - the deployment files will be inside the `/build` directoty

## Hosting Fresco from a subdirectory

Fresco is able to be hosted from a subdirectory of a domain (i.e. https://yourhost.com/fresco/). To enable this functionality, modify the `package.json` file


``` json
{
  "name": "fresco",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "homepage": "/fresco",
...

```

Also, you'll need to modify the config inside `/src/config/index.json`.

``` json
{
	"homepage": "/fresco"
}
```

Then use `npm run build` to build Fresco for deployment.

## Change default Fresco styles

You are able to change the default styles that Fresco loads up with. Update `/src/config/stylesDefault.json` with any number of Mapbox style JSONs. To load multiple styles in use an array structure like shown below:

``` json
[
	{
		"id": "style1",
		...
	},{
		"id": "style2",
		...
	}
]
```

For a single style, just replace the contents of `/src/config/stylesDefault.json` with the style JSON.

When testing default styles, you'll have to clear out your localStorage `frescoStylesStore` or use an incognito window.
